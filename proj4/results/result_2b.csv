From the outside it looked nice but the inside isn't nice at all...not sure why people are saying it is.  I didn't have an appointment but they took me anyways, which was nice.  I just got a manicure and it was minimal.  I mean that I washed my hands, she pushed back my cuticles and trimmed them and got started painting...then when she was done that was it.  My nails look pretty good although the sides were not fully painted.  Even though my nails look good I am not sure I would go back because getting your nails done should be a luxurious time to relax and get pampered. I often find that if things say, luxury or upscale they are really not.  The overall look of the place was dirty and I wouldn't want to get my toes done here because it looked uncomfortable and not that clean.  Both women that were there were very nice and I appreciated that very much."

(and I have had alot of them) So delicious,  beautifully seasoned,  and super tender. We also got the Koubideh, that was also well seasoned, was cooked well, and was still juicy and tender. And last, but not least, the Ghorme Sabzi was so great. The strew could use a little more beans, but it was so well-cooked and tasted like those you'd have at your mom's or auntie's house Keep up the great work, Molana!"

The design is very open, clean, and inviting, they appear to support a beach theme.  The staff is dressed in white to complement the airy vibe.  What I noticed immediately is the friendliness-everyone seemed so happy and upbeat.  I loved that.The food was also very very good.  I thought the guac and corn tortillas were really good and also the chicken bowl with brown rice was very flavorful.  You can taste the fresh cilantro prevalent in a lot of their dishes.I had a margarita (okay 3 margaritas lol) that was honestly one of the best I've had in a really really long time.  They have high quality aged tequila and use fresh squeezed juices for every drink.  Don't miss out on their cocktail selections. I'm impressed and look forward to returning."

021UtGruSN1RA5YRS92E7w,6cyn5sP2OCarYV02KWtuGQ,5HMXgD_gui5n0Tc_hadesg,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,The atmosphere is great for drinks but I'd say its a little overpriced for what it is. The poutine is good and worth it. I got the rabbit tacos and the rabbit was a little grainy and the tacos were basic. I think they could have been better.

This was the second time we went. The first time we went, we got the same thing and it came with a few veggies. Keep in mind that that's literally the price as a bowl of pho with beef. Also, we ordered a cup of iced tea, and got a cup of lemon flavoured water. There was not much flavour, and it definitely didn't taste like iced tea. So I guess it depends when you go."

Wow, I was surprised! Having read all the great write-ups and reviews online...I was expecting a great slice of pizza...they def lived up to my expectations. The crust was delicious, sauce was great...greasy, but in a good way! It's not the type of pizza I could eat every week, but once in a while. :) Veggie pizza is excellent, so is the classic cheese. Don't go here expecting a classy pizza joint - it's far from it, but you want a great and flavorful pizza...don't hesitate to stop by!"

Went to Cala bar with my husband,the service was slow(only about 10 customers inside at the time ), the manager was rude when I spoke to her about my food being raw. So after waiting 45 min for wings (wings were okay) they served me raw salmon and then told me only the chef can determine if it's raw ... no ma'am I am eating it , if I say it's raw then it's raw. Mind you it took about an hour to get my meal and to send it out raw .. I was so annoyed .. then they microwave it and bought it back out ... no thank you ..... I would not recommend anyone going here. They need new management or train the one that's there. Just save your money and go else where .. you will thank me later."
